chibicc is the simplest/tiniest/hackable/readable c11 compiler in the
world that can build projects like python but goes 2x slower than gcc
with 2x the code size, because it doesn't optimize or color registers
although it can compile code at 5x the speed and could be even faster
which is great, considering it's a 220kb αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε
